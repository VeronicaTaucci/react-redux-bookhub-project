# Book Hub

App built with React and Redux.

## Overview
I built this app that provides a space for book lovers to search for books from an API and keep records of their reading journey (saving favorite quotes, adding comments, leaving rating and track progress). The data is stored in the browser’s local storage and loaded into the application’s global state when the page refreshes or loads.
The main purpose of the project was a practical approach in learning React and Redux.
